This analysis was carried out following the 5 stages of data analytics: identification, data collection, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
As mentioned in the description, the analysis is meant to help a potential buyer make the best decision regarding the purchase of a firm. We identify that using a dataset of at least 6 month sale records should suffice the purpose.
We then start the collection process which only requires the current owner to provide us with the needed data.
There was nothing much to clean but the data was prepared and summarized to ease the analytics process. For example, the date column was populated to group by Month and a new column contianing the Profit was calculated from the Sales and Expenses columns.
Then, the visualization was done with PowerBI and the descriptive analysis was carried out using MS PowerPoint.

It's discovered that the new buyer can go ahead with the deal due to the huge success achieved by the firm within the spate of 6 months.
